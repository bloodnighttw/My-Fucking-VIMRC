# My Fucking VIMRC 

The repo share my ``.vimrc`` to other and backup it.

I use VIM for c++ (mainly) or python coding,use Jetbrains Intellij IDEA with VIM Plugin for java coding.

NOTE! I am not the master of VIM , __ BUT VIM REALLY HELP ME RISE THE SPEED OF CODING , AND YOU SHOULD TRY IT IF YOU ARE WRITE C++ OR PYTHON __

If this repo really help you,pls consider star,thanks.

## How to use
1. Install Vundle (check the [Vundel repo](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle) to see how to install)
2. Download the ``.vimrc`` in this repo and replace your ``.vimrc`` into my ``.vimrc``
3. Open VIM,Type ``:PluginInstall`` (in normal mode) to install all the plugin!
4. After the install,ENJOY!

## Q&A

Q1: Why VIM ?

A1: VIM is Fast,Lightweight,and if you have learned how to use VIM , VIM will speed up your speed of coding!

Q2: Can I Copy it to my ``.vimrc``?

A2: Yes,of course.

Q3: Can I use this ``.vimrc`` to write Python?

A3: Yes. Just Type ``:CocInstall coc-python`` inside the VIM(In Normal mode) , and coc.nvim will install the python plugin and language server.

Q4: Can I use this ``.vimrc`` to write JAVA?

A4: Yes. **BUT I DON'T RECOMMAND YOU TO USE ``coc-java`` TO WRITE JAVA CODE BECAUSE JDT.LS IS NOT POWERFUL AS OTHER IDE(I THINK) .** Try Jetbrains Intellij IDEA with VIM Plugin!It will also speed up your speed of coding.

Q5: Other Language?

A5: You Should search by yourself. Try Google "coc.nvim XXX" (XXX is your language name),I think there will have a lot of result.
